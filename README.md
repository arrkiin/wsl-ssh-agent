Windows 10 has very convenient `ssh-agent` service (with support for persistence and Windows security). Unfortunately it is
not accessible from WSL. This project aims to correct this situation by enabling access to SSH keys held by Windows own
`ssh-agent` service from inside the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/about).

My first attempt - [ssh-agent-wsl](https://github.com/rupor-github/ssh-agent-wsl) was successful, but due to Windows interop restrictions
it required elaborate life-time management on the WSL side. Starting with build 17063 (which was many updates ago) Windows implemented AF_UNIX sockets.
This makes it possible to remove all trickery from WSL side greatly simplifying everything.

`wsl-ssh-agent-gui.exe` is a simple "notification tray" applet which maintains AF_UNIX ssh-agent compatible socket on Windows
end. It proxes all requests from this socket to ssh-agent.exe via named pipe. The only thing required on WSL end for it to work
is to make sure that WSL `SSH_AGENT_SOCK` points to proper socket path. The same socket could be shared by any/all WSL sessions.

As an additional bonus `wsl-ssh-agent-gui.exe` could work as [lemonade](https://github.com/rupor-github/lemonade) server so you could send your
clipboard from tmux or neovim remote session back to your windows box over SSH secured connection easily. Running `lemonade.exe` console
application in the background on Windows was always a bit tedious. Please, read lemonade documentation for details on how this works and parameters description.

**SECURITY NOTICE:** All the usual security caveats applicable to WSL apply.
Most importantly, all interaction with the Win32 world happens with the credentials of
the user who started the WSL environment. In practice, *if you allow someone else to
log in to your WSL environment remotely, they may be able to access the SSH keys stored in
your ssh-agent.* This is a fundamental feature of WSL; if you are not sure of what you're doing, do not allow remote access to
your WSL environment (i.e. by starting an SSH server).

**COMPATIBILITY NOTICE:** `wsl-ssh-agent-gui` was tested on Windows 10 1903 with multiple distributions and should work on anything
starting with 1809 - beginning with insider build 17063 and would not work on older versions of Windows 10, because it requires
[AF_UNIX socket support](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/af_unix-comes-to-windows/) feature.

## Installation

### From binaries

Download from the [releases page](https://github.com/rupor-github/wsl-ssh-agent/releases) and unpack it in a convenient location.

### From source

It is possible to build sources on Windows - after all it is written in _go_, however I am building under WSL, so you will need at least
go 1.13 installed under WSL along with regular build essentials and recent cmake:
	`sudo apt install build-essential cmake`
After that just execute
	`./build-release.sh`

## Usage

1. Ensure that on Windows side `ssh-agent.exe` service (OpenSSH Authentication Agent) is started and has your keys. (After adding keys to Windows `ssh-agent.exe` you may remove them from your wsl home .ssh directory - just do not forget to adjust `IdentitiesOnly` directive in your ssh config accordingly. Keys are securely persisted in Windows registry, available for your account only). You may also want to switch its startup mode to "automatic". Using powershell with elevated privileges (admin mode):
```
	Start-Service ssh-agent
	Set-Service -StartupType Automatic ssh-agent
```

2. Run `wsl-ssh-agent-gui.exe` with arguments which make sense for your usage. Basically there are several ways:

	* Using `-socket` option specify "well known" path on Windows side and then properly specify the same path in every WSL session:

		Windows:
		    ```
			wsl-ssh-agent-gui.exe -socket c:\wsl-ssh-agent\ssh-agent.sock
		    ```

		WSL:
		    ```
		    export SSH_AUTH_SOCK=/mnt/c/wsl-ssh-agent/ssh-agent.sock
		    ```

    * You could avoid any actions on WSL side by manually setting `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` and `WSLENV=SSH_AUTH_SOCK/up` on Windows side (**see note below**).

	* Using `-setenv` option allows application automatically modify user environment, so every WSL session started while
      `wsl-ssh-agent-gui.exe` is running will have proper `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` available to it (using `WSLENV`). By default socket
      path points to user temporary directory. Usual Windows user environment modification rules are applicable here (**see note below**).

**NOTE:** Setting SSH_AUTH_SOCK environment on Windows side may (and probably will) interfere with some of Windows OpenSSH. As far as I could see presently utilities in `Windows\System32\OpenSSH` expect this environment variable to be either empty or set to proper `ssh-agent.exe` pipe, otherwise they cannot read socket:

```
	if (getenv("SSH_AUTH_SOCK") == NULL)
		_putenv("SSH_AUTH_SOCK=\\\\.\\pipe\\openssh-ssh-agent");
```

To avoid this and still be able to use `-setenv` and automatically generated socket path use `-envname` to specify variable name to set. Later on WSL side you could use:
```
export SSH_AUTH_SOCK=${<<YOUR-NAME-HERE>>}
```

When `wsl-ssh-agent-gui.exe` is running you could see what it is connected to by clicking on its icon in notification tray area and selecting `About`. At the bottom of the message you would see something like:
```
Socket path:
  C:\Users\rupor\AppData\Local\Temp\ssh-273683143.sock
Pipe name:
  \\.\pipe\openssh-ssh-agent
Lemonade stand:
  2489;127.0.0.1/24
```

For security reasons unless `-nolock` argument is specified program will refuse access to `ssh-agent.exe` pipe when user session is locked, so any long running background jobs in WSL which require ssh may fail.

## Options

## WSL 2 compatibility

At the moment (at least with build 19041.450) AF_UNIX interop does not seems to be working with WSL2 VMs. Either that or I simply cannot figure out how to make it work. Hopefully this will be sorted out eventually.
Meantime there is an easy workaround (proposed by multiple people) which does not use wsl-ssh-agent.exe at all and relies on combination of linux socat tool from your distribution and [npiperelay.exe](https://github.com/jstarks/npiperelay). Put npiperelay.exe somewhere on devfs for interop to work its magic (I have `winhome â‡’ /mnt/c/Users/rupor` in my $HOME directory for that) and add following lines in your .bashrc/.zshrc:

```
export SSH_AUTH_SOCK=$HOME/.ssh/agent.sock
ss -a | grep -q $SSH_AUTH_SOCK
if [ $? -ne 0   ]; then
    rm -f $SSH_AUTH_SOCK
    ( setsid socat UNIX-LISTEN:$SSH_AUTH_SOCK,fork EXEC:"$HOME/winhome/.wsl/npiperelay.exe -ei -s //./pipe/openssh-ssh-agent",nofork & ) >/dev/null 2>&1
fi
```
You *really* have to be on WSL 2 in order for this to work - if you see errors like `Cannot open netlink socket: Protocol not supported` - you probably are under WSL 1 and should not use this workaround. Run `wsl.exe -l -all -v` to check what is going on. When on WSL 2 make sure that socat is installed and npiperelay.exe is on windows partition and path is right. For convinience I will be packing pre-build npiperelay.exe with wsl-ssh-agent.

## Example

Putting it all together nicely - `remote` here refers to your wsl shell or some other box or virtual machine you could `ssh` to. Assuming that [lemonade](https://github.com/rupor-github/lemonade) is in your path on `remote` and you installed [win32yank](https://github.com/equalsraf/win32yank) somewhere in `drvfs` location.

I auto-start `wsl-ssh-agent-gui.exe` on logon on my Windows box using following command line:
```
wsl-ssh-agent-gui.exe -setenv -envname=WSL_AUTH_SOCK -lemonade=2489;127.0.0.1/24
```
In my .bashrc I have:
```
[ -n ${WSL_AUTH_SOCK} ] && export SSH_AUTH_SOCK=${WSL_AUTH_SOCK}
```
and my `.ssh/config` entries used to `ssh` to `remote` have port forwarding enabled:
```
RemoteForward 2489 127.0.0.1:2489
```
On `remote` my `tmux.conf` includes following lines:
```
set -g set-clipboard off
bind-key -T copy-mode-vi Enter send-keys -X copy-pipe-and-cancel "~/.local/bin/lemonade copy"
bind-key -T copy-mode-vi MouseDragEnd1Pane send-keys -X copy-pipe-and-cancel "~/.local/bin/lemonade copy"
```
And my `neovim` configuration file `init.vim` on `remote` has following lines:
```
" ----- Clipboard
set clipboard+=unnamedplus
if has("unix")
	" ----- on UNIX ask lemonade to translate line-endings
	if executable('lemonade')
		let g:clipboard = {
			\   'name': 'lemonade',
			\   'copy': {
			\      '+': 'lemonade copy',
			\      '*': 'lemonade copy',
			\    },
			\   'paste': {
			\      '+': 'lemonade paste --line-ending lf',
			\      '*': 'lemonade paste --line-ending lf',
			\   },
			\   'cache_enabled': 0,
			\ }
	endif
endif
```

Now you could open your WSL in terminal of your choice - mintty, cmd, Windows terminal, `ssh` to your `remote` using keys stored in Windows `ssh-agent.exe` without entering any additional passwords and have your clipboard content back on Windows transparently.
